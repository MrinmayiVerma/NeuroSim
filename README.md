# 🧠 NeuroSim: A Scientific Neuron Simulation Platform

**NeuroSim** is a scientifically designed web application that allows users to simulate simplified neuron models and analyze their behaviors under various physiological parameters. Built as a full-stack platform using **React (frontend)**, **Flask (backend)**, and **MySQL (database)**, this project was developed with a strong emphasis on usability for neuroscience education and research prototyping.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To provide an interactive and accessible web interface for exploring fundamental neuron dynamics, helping students and researchers gain insights into:
- Neural excitability
- Membrane potential dynamics
- Spike train patterns

## 🧪 Implemented Neuron Models

### 🔹 Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
A widely used, biophysically inspired model that simulates a neuron's passive membrane dynamics.

### 🔹 Izhikevich Model
A more complex model that combines biological plausibility with computational efficiency. It captures diverse spiking behaviors and cortical firing patterns.
